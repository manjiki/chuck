Common sense indicates that it requires\nmore to defeat an incarnation of evil than hurling lumps of lead or silver\nthrough its body.  One time-honored method is to expose the vampire to the\nsun, sever its head (any power saw should be sufficient), fill its mouth with\nholy wafers (vanilla wafers over which the Lord\'s prayer has been read will\ndo in a pinch), immerse the head in an urn filled with holy water, place the\nurn in consecrated lands and bury the rest of the body underneath a crossroad\n(i.e. the intersection of Broad & Chestnut).
